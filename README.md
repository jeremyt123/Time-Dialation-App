# Time-Dialation-App

This is an Andriod app created in Android studio

The app takes in a speed input and then has the user select a destination in the universe
Once a destination is selected the app will display information about the destination along with 2 travel times:
one time will be travel time for the person in the ship and the other will be from perspective from earth (taking time dialation into account)
